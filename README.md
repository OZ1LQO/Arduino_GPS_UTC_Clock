Arduino_GPS_UTC_Clock
=====================

A UTC GPS Clock based on Arduino

This project was inspired by the arduino tutorial on arduino.cc and the fact that I had a display AND a GPS module
on the shelf, doing nothing.. :) I published the code so other can use it and wrote an article about it in the Danish 
ham radio magazine, 'OZ'.
I doubt there will be any further changes and/or updates, but contact me if you have suggestions for more functionality
or found some flaws in the code.

Besides that, HAVE FUN - enjoy the arduino :-)

cheers
